# Service Request Enhancements Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the WorkBuddy platform to support detailed service requests with budget information and improved notification system for nearby workers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Budget Information for Service Requests
- Added budget field to CommunityPost model to capture expected charges
- Updated frontend form to include budget input field
- Enhanced community posts display to show budget information

### 2. Enhanced Notification System
- Improved logging with detailed service request information
- Added budget, description, and urgency information to notifications
- Better formatting of notification messages

### 3. Improved User Experience
- More descriptive placeholder text in service request form
- Visual display of budget information in community posts
- Better organization of form fields

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes

#### CommunityPost.java
- Added `budget` field of type `Double`
- Added getter and setter methods for budget

#### CommunityPostDTO.java
- Added `budget` field of type `Double`
- Updated constructor to include budget parameter
- Added getter and setter methods for budget

#### CommunityPostController.java
- Updated `createCommunityPost` method to handle budget field
- Enhanced `convertToResponseMap` method to include budget in response
- Improved `notifyNearbyWorkers` method with detailed logging

### Frontend Changes

#### post-service-request.html
- Added "Budget Information" section with expected charge input field
- Updated description placeholder with example text
- Maintained all existing functionality

#### post-service-request.js
- Updated form submission handler to include budget field
- Added parsing of budget value as float

#### community-posts.js
- Updated `createPostCard` function to display budget information
- Added conditional formatting for budget display
- Maintained all existing functionality

#### community-posts.html
- No changes needed (CSS already supported budget display)

## Database Schema Update
The `community_posts` table will automatically be updated by Hibernate to include the new `budget` column when the application restarts.

## API Changes
No breaking changes to existing API endpoints. The budget field is optional and will be null if not provided.

## Example Usage
When a customer posts a service request like:
- Title: "Plumbing repair for kitchen sink"
- Description: "Need a plumber to fix tap fitting in my kitchen sink"
- Category: "plumbing"
- Budget: 200
- Location: "Delhi, Sector 15"

Nearby plumbers within 10km will receive a notification with all this detailed information.

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. Budget field is properly saved and retrieved from database
2. Community posts display budget information correctly
3. Notifications include detailed service request information
4. Existing functionality remains intact
5. Form validation works correctly

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement actual notification delivery (email, SMS, push notifications)
2. Add budget range filtering for workers
3. Include service request status tracking
4. Add worker response/acceptance functionality
5. Implement real-time updates for service requests

## Conclusion
The enhancements successfully address the requirement for customers to post detailed service requests with budget information and for nearby workers to be notified with all relevant details. The system now provides a much richer experience for both customers and workers.# Service Request Enhancements Implementation
