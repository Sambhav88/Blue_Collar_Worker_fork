# Community Posts Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the community posts feature that allows both customers and workers to make posts about services, with specific visibility rules and notification functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Community Posts Visibility Rules
- **Customers** can only see:
  - Their own posts (service requests)
  - Service offers from workers (only from active workers)
- **Workers** can only see:
  - Their own posts (service offers)
  - Service requests from customers

### 2. Worker Active/Inactive Status Management
- Toggle button in worker dashboard to switch between active/inactive status
- Only active workers' services are shown to customers
- Worker status is persisted in the database
- API endpoint for updating worker status: `PATCH /api/auth/worker/status`

### 3. Geolocation-based Notifications
- When a customer posts a service request, nearby workers (within 10km) are notified
- Notifications are filtered to only active workers
- Matching is done based on service category

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### CommunityPostController.java
- Updated `getCustomerPosts()` endpoint to filter worker service offers to only show those from active workers
- Updated `getWorkerPosts()` endpoint to maintain proper visibility rules
- Enhanced `notifyNearbyWorkers()` method to filter notifications to only active workers

#### WorkController.java
- Already had filtering in place to only show works from active workers to customers
- Uses `workService.getAvailableWorksForCustomers()` which filters by worker availability

#### UsersController.java
- Worker status update endpoint already existed at `PATCH /api/auth/worker/status`
- Updates the `isAvailable` field in the Users entity

### Frontend Changes
- Worker dashboard already had the toggle switch for active/inactive status
- JavaScript handles the API call to update worker status
- Community posts pages already implemented with proper role-based navigation

### Database Schema
- Community posts are stored in the `community_posts` table
- Worker availability is tracked in the `users` table with the `is_available` field
- Geolocation data (latitude/longitude) is stored with each community post for distance calculations

## API Endpoints

### Community Posts
- `POST /api/community-posts` - Create a new community post
- `GET /api/community-posts/customer` - Get posts for customer (own posts + worker offers from active workers)
- `GET /api/community-posts/worker` - Get posts for worker (own posts + customer requests)
- `GET /api/community-posts/my-posts` - Get only the user's own posts
- `DELETE /api/community-posts/{postId}` - Delete a community post

### Worker Status
- `PATCH /api/auth/worker/status` - Update worker availability status

## Testing

The application has been successfully started and tested to ensure:
1. Worker status toggle works correctly
2. Only active workers' services are visible to customers
3. Community posts visibility follows the specified rules
4. Notification system identifies nearby active workers

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement actual notification delivery (email, SMS, push notifications)
2. Add more sophisticated matching algorithms for worker-customer pairing
3. Implement real-time updates for community posts using WebSockets
